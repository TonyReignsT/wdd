    <p> Kenya is famous for its wildlife and conservation efforts. It is one of the few places in the world where you can see the "Big Five" (lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo, and rhino) in their natural habitat. The annual Great Wildebeest Migration in the Maasai Mara is one of the most spectacular wildlife events on the planet, attracting visitors from all over the globe.</p>
